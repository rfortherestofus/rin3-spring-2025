# Quarto Question

> I work in HR and we generate a lot of individual variations of generic letters (recognition of x years of service, formal notification of pay increases including the employee's current pay + their % increase and resulting new salary). I could probably set something up to generate those sorts of letters in Quarto, right?

Think about unit of analysis

Try to plot your data and if you can't, it's probably not tidy

## Tidy Data Rule #1: Every Column is a Variable {.inverse}

## Tidy Data Rule #2: Every Row is an Observation {.inverse}

## Tidy Data Rule #3: Every Cell is a Single Value {.inverse}

## Tidy Data Question

> When working with "select all that apply" variables in the past in datasets where one row = one individual, I've typically dealt with this by converting each response option to its own column where a 1 ("yes") is present if that response option was selected. This has worked well for my purposes, but I understand now that it violates Tidy Data Rule 1 because a single variable is spread across multiple columns. Am I understanding correctly that while the approach I've used in the paste is not inherently better or worse than tidy format, the advantage to making it tidy is that it will be easier to analyze using tidyverse? Is this still true if the unit of analysis I'm interested in is the individual and not the activity (for example)?
