# Question on Function Arguments

. . .

I'm seeing a difference in the syntax used in the main video vs the solution video and am wondering if you can please explain the difference. In the main video, you use `separate_longer_delim(cols = activities,...` but the solution video uses `separate_longer_delim(partyid,...` without the use of `cols =`.

# Tidy Example Project

::: {.notes}
- make demographics data frame
- make function to import data
- show importing multiple years of data
- make function to work with slightly different data (2021): show doing extra steps after function and within it (show rename() not working, but use set_names() instead)
- in report, show merging demographics data frame in
- make function to create data viz for any year

<!-- # A Few of Our Favorite Functions -->

<!-- - You've created a function in the context of data cleaning, but functions can be for anything -->

<!-- - You'll learn later how to make a custom ggplot theme that is a function -->
