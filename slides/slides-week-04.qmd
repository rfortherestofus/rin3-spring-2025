# Quarto Exercise {.inverse}

## Quarto Exercise

1. Copy the code from [this Quarto document](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfortherestofus/rin3-fall-2024/main/misc/no-render.qmd). Figure out why it won't render and change it so that it will!

1. Copy the code from [this second Quarto document](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfortherestofus/rin3-fall-2024/main/misc/guess-what.qmd). There are a series of questions in it. Tackle them one by one, making changes to the document as you do so.

## How to structure your Quarto documents

1. Load packages at top

1. Import data at top

1. Custom functions at top

1. Code chunks used throughout to make outputs (graphs, tables, maps, etc)

1. I also do data cleaning/tidying in a separate R script file (you'll learn about this soon)

## How I use Quarto documents is not how you have to use Quarto documents!

. . .

> So, is the purpose of Quarto primarily for data viz? It isn't something that for example you'd use for summary stats unless have some visual component with it?

. . .

Many people do data cleaning and exploratory data analysis in Quarto documents!

## How to change the size of plots in Quarto documents

```{r}
#| echo: true
penguins |> 
  count(island) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = island, 
             y = n)) +
  geom_col()
```

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| fig-height: 1

  count(island) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = island, 
             y = n)) +
  geom_col()
```

## How to change the look and feel of Quarto documents

- Depends on output format

- For HTML, [use a combination of themes and custom CSS](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-themes.html)

- For Word, use [reference documents](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/ms-word-templates.html)

- For PDF, check out [`typst` format](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/typst.html)

- There are lessons on each of these later in R in 3 Months!

# General Tip {.inverse}

## How to Make Sense of R Help Docs

> I looked into the geomtextpath package and even found a fairly helpful guide (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/geomtextpath/vignettes/geomtextpath.html) but I'm still at a loss on how to incorporate the names into the lines themselves. I wish I were better at understanding the Help guides.
