<!-- I work in HR and we generate a lot of individual variations of generic letters (recognition of x years of service, formal notification of pay increases including the employeeâ€™s current pay + their % increase and resulting new salary). I could probably set something up to generate those sorts of letters in Quarto, right? -->

Dear `r hr_data_filtered$formal_name`,

Your current salary is `r dollar(hr_data_filtered$current_salary)`. You are set to receive a `r hr_data_filtered$increase_percent` percent increase in your salary. Your new salary will be `r dollar(hr_data_filtered$new_salary)`.

If you have any questions, please let us know.

Best wishes,

HR
